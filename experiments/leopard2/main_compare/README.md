# Exact Leopard master benchmark adapter

This standalone project builds the legacy codec only from detached Leopard
revision `6e5725ebdf9da4370b0bcc4f70fa8eb66f4e6198`. It does not link the
Leopard2 checkout's library and it is not included by the repository's normal
CMake build.

The adapter mirrors `bench/leopard2/benchmark.cpp` where the APIs overlap:
deterministic XorShift64 input generation and missing-shard selection, aligned
storage allocated before timing, every transmitted parity shard supplied to
decode, batch/reuse/warmup/iteration semantics, and median/MAD/minimum/maximum
summaries. Correctness and workload digests are computed before warmup.
Legacy decode necessarily includes its locator and other pattern-dependent
setup on every call; the JSON records that fact explicitly.

Workload fingerprints use FNV-1a-64 with offset
`14695981039346656037` and prime `1099511628211`, rendered as 16 lowercase
hexadecimal digits. Traversal is stripe index, shard index, then byte. The
`recovered_originals` shard order is the sorted
`missing_original_indices` list. The fields are:

    workload_digests.algorithm
    workload_digests.original_data
    workload_digests.transmitted_parity
    workload_digests.recovered_originals

Every encode and decode iteration is retained chronologically under
`samples_us_per_batch_call`; summary values are derived from those arrays.

## Build and smoke test

Create a detached baseline outside both the Leopard2 source and build trees:

    git worktree add --detach /tmp/leopard-main-exact \
        6e5725ebdf9da4370b0bcc4f70fa8eb66f4e6198

Configure the standalone project. Its configure step rejects the wrong commit,
a symbolic branch checkout, or tracked modifications. The exact master sources
form a private static archive; only that archive is linked into the adapter.
The build retains `compile_commands.json`, and its smoke test requires every
codec and adapter translation unit to carry the canonical master's effective
Release flags: `-march=native -Wall -Wextra -fopenmp -g -O0 -O3`, without
`-DNDEBUG`.

    cmake -S experiments/leopard2/main_compare \
        -B build/leopard-main-compare -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DLEOPARD_MAIN_SOURCE_DIR=/tmp/leopard-main-exact
    cmake --build build/leopard-main-compare -j "$(nproc)"
    ctest --test-dir build/leopard-main-compare --output-on-failure

For a single JSON cell:

    build/leopard-main-compare/leopard_main_benchmark \
        --k 240 --r 16 --bytes 64KiB --loss 3 --batch 1 \
        --reuse 8 --iterations 9 --warmup 2 --threads 1 \
        --seed 1 --json -

This executable is one half of a comparison. An authoritative Leopard2 versus
master claim still requires process-level counterbalancing, identical parameter
and workload-digest checks, CPU isolation, executable/source identity capture,
and paired confidence intervals.
